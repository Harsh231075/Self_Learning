## 🧩 Problem Statement

> In today's fast-paced world, learners are often overwhelmed by too much content, confused about where to begin, or unsure of what suits their goals.

> But in reality, many students need **guidance, structure, and motivation** — and that’s what this platform delivers.

This project solves real-world learning challenges by offering a smart dashboard that supports both **clear learners** and **confused learners**, ensuring everyone gets a personalized journey powered by AI.
